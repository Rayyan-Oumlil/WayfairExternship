# Project 1: Getting Started with AI Agents - Moodboard Generator

**Wayfair AI Automation Externship (via Extern)**  
**Student:** Rayyan Oumlil  
**Project:** Getting Started with AI Agents - Moodboard Generator

---

## üìã Project Overview

### Objective
Build your first AI agent: a Moodboard Generator that turns simple prompts like "modern living room with warm colors" into visuals. This hands-on win sets you up to build more advanced agents that will track market shifts, monitor competitors, and generate insights that matter for Wayfair.

### Business Context
Before you can track real rug trends or analyze competitors, you need to understand how AI agents actually work. This simple tool takes a style idea like "Bohemian rugs, neutral tones" and instantly turns it into a visual board. It's a playful warm-up, but it introduces the exact mechanics you'll use to build more advanced agents later.

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Project Structure (3 Steps)
This project was divided into 3 steps, each with short trainings and tasks:

| Step | Estimated Time | Focus |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Step 1: Setting Up Your AI Workspace | ~1 hour 10 mins | n8n setup, basic workflows |
| Step 2: Turning Style Ideas Into Prompts | ~50 minutes | Prompt engineering fundamentals |
| Step 3: Creating Your Moodboard Generator Agent | ~1 hour 20 mins | Complete end-to-end agent |

### Workflow Architecture
```
Chat Input ‚Üí AI Agent (Gemini) ‚Üí Clean Prompt ‚Üí HTTP Request (Gemini Image) ‚Üí Parse Response ‚Üí Convert to File
```

### Key Learning Modules

1. **Introduction to AI Agents**
   - Understanding the difference between chatbots and agents
   - Real-world examples: Competely (competitive intelligence) and Devin (AI coding)
   - Core traits: Autonomy, Tool use, Loops

2. **n8n Platform Mastery**
   - Account setup and workspace exploration
   - Building "Hello World" workflow
   - Understanding nodes, connections, and executions
   - Creating logic with If nodes and data flow

3. **Prompt Engineering Fundamentals**
   - Building blocks: Subject + Style + Details
   - Iteration process: from rough idea to polished output
   - Few-shot prompting techniques
   - Wayfair-specific visual guidelines

4. **API Integration**
   - Understanding API calls and image generation
   - Gemini API configuration and parameters
   - Error handling and rate limit management

## üéØ Key Features

### Prompt Engineering
- **Subject + Style + Details** framework
- Few-shot examples for consistent output
- Professional photography direction
- Brand-appropriate visual guidelines

### Error Handling
- API rate limit detection (429 errors)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback to HTML moodboard when API fails
- Graceful degradation

### Output Quality
- High-resolution images (480x320+)
- Consistent visual style
- Professional composition
- No watermarks or branding

## üìä Results & Testing

### Sample Inputs Tested
1. "Bohemian rugs, neutral tones, woven texture, jute, living room"
2. "Scandinavian minimalist rugs, light wood, monochrome, quiet living"
3. "Eco-friendly jute rug with neutral tones"

### Performance Metrics
- **Success Rate:** 85% (API rate limits affected some runs)
- **Average Processing Time:** 15-30 seconds
- **Image Quality:** Professional, catalog-ready
- **Prompt Accuracy:** High consistency with input style

### Project Reflection (From Extern Platform)
- **Highlight Reel:** Seeing the first working workflow come together in n8n, watching prompts move through each node from text input to clean prompt to image generation
- **Skill Growth:** Improved understanding of APIs and how to connect them within workflow tools like n8n. Gained confidence in troubleshooting and reading JSON responses
- **Biggest Challenge:** Gemini API hitting request limits and stopping image generation. Stayed patient, retraced steps, checked setup, and learned better rate limit handling
- **Improvement Suggestion:** Clearer log or visual alert system inside n8n to quickly spot where workflows break, making debugging smoother

### Challenges Encountered
- **API Rate Limits:** Gemini free tier limitations
- **Solution:** Implemented retry logic and HTML fallback
- **Learning:** Better understanding of API management

## üöÄ Business Impact

### For Wayfair Teams
This agent supports Wayfair's Rugs category team by reducing the time from style hypothesis to tangible visual brief. Given a style cue (e.g., "bohemian, neutral"), it produces a consistent palette, search queries, and visual grid that merchandisers and marketers can discuss immediately.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Time Savings:** Reduces moodboard creation from hours to minutes
- **Consistency:** Standardized visual briefs across team
- **Iteration Speed:** Quick style variations for A/B testing
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces need for external design resources
- **Speed to Market:** Faster trend validation and iteration

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with Wayfair's product catalog
- SKU-aware moodboards with real products
- Price band integration
- Material and color tag mapping
- Automated trend analysis and reporting

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- n8n Cloud (14-day trial)
- Google Gemini API key
- No additional software required

### File Formats
- Input: Text strings via chat
- Output: PNG images (base64 ‚Üí file conversion)
- Fallback: HTML moodboards with placeholder images

### API Usage
- **Gemini Chat Model:** For prompt engineering
- **Gemini Image Model:** For visual generation
- **Rate Limits:** Managed with retry logic

## üìà Lessons Learned

### Technical Skills Developed
- **n8n Platform:** Building low-code AI agents and workflows
- **Prompt Engineering:** Subject + Style + Details framework for visual outputs
- **API Integration:** Gemini API configuration and error handling
- **Data Processing:** JSON parsing and data transformation
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Connecting nodes and managing data flow
- **Debugging:** Troubleshooting API calls and rate limits

### Process Insights
- **Iteration is Key:** Prompts improve dramatically with refinement
- **Error Handling:** Crucial for production use, especially with API limits
- **Fallback Strategies:** Ensure reliability when external services fail
- **Documentation:** Helps with debugging and knowledge transfer
- **User Experience:** Simple inputs should produce professional outputs

### Key Takeaways from Extern Program
- **AI Agents vs Chatbots:** Agents act autonomously, chatbots just respond
- **Focus Matters:** Great agents do one job really well
- **Future-Ready:** What feels like a toy today becomes infrastructure tomorrow
- **Hands-On Learning:** Building is the best way to understand AI capabilities
