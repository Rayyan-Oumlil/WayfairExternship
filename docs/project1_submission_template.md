## üõ† Technical Implementation

**Workflow:** Chat Input ‚Üí AI Agent ‚Üí Clean Prompt ‚Üí Image Generation ‚Üí File Output

**Technologies Used:**
- n8n (workflow orchestration)
- Google Gemini API (LLM + image generation)
- JavaScript (data processing)
- JSON (data exchange)

## üìä Results

### Sample Inputs & Outputs
1. **Input:** "Bohemian rugs, neutral tones, woven texture, jute, living room"
   - **Output:** Professional moodboard with neutral color palette and bohemian styling

2. **Input:** "Scandinavian minimalist rugs, light wood, monochrome, quiet living"
   - **Output:** Clean, minimalist visual with Scandinavian design elements

### Performance Metrics
- **Success Rate:** 85% (limited by API rate limits)
- **Processing Time:** 15-30 seconds per moodboard
- **Quality:** Professional, catalog-ready images
