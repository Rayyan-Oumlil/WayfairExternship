# Project 5: Integrating Agents into the Market Intelligence Dashboard

## Overview

In this project, you'll unify everything you've built: trends, competitors, and AI insights into a single Market Intelligence Dashboard. This is where your agents stop working in isolation and start powering real business decisions. You'll connect live data pipelines, automate updates, and design a Google Sheets dashboard that delivers instant, actionable intelligence for Wayfair's Rugs team. To wrap it all up, you'll also create a presentation that highlights your dashboard, key insights, and the story your data tells.

## Why This, Why Now?

This is where everything you've built finally comes alive.

Over the past projects, you've taught your agents to collect, analyze, and create: identifying user intent, scraping market data, spotting competitor patterns, and turning insights into ideas.

Now it's time to connect every piece into a living business system: one that helps Wayfair's team see market movement, spot gaps, and act faster.

In this project, you'll transform your workflow into a real-time intelligence dashboard and present your findings as a strategic business story.

**Now, you'll learn to think and present like a strategist.**

Wayfair teams use dashboards like these to:
- Track emerging product trends and pricing shifts
- Monitor competitors' assortment and messaging
- Identify whitespace opportunities before they hit the mainstream

By the end, you'll have a working AI-driven market intelligence system and the confidence to explain its business impact.

## Project Breakdown

This project is divided into two steps that combine integration and strategic storytelling.

| Step | Estimated Time | Modules | Tasks |
|------|----------------|---------|-------|
| Step 1: Merging Trend, Competitor, and Insight Pipelines | 2 hours | 1 | 1 |
| Step 2: Presenting Business Impact | 1.5 hours | 1 | 1 |

## What Are You Working Towards?

By the end of this project, you'll have:
- A live Google Sheets dashboard that visualizes user intent, competitor, trend, and content insights
- A 5–7 minute Loom presentation that explains your system and its implications for Wayfair's business strategy

You'll connect the dots between data and decisions, showing how intelligence translates into real impact.

## Progress

### Step 1: Merging Trend, Competitor, and Insight Pipelines ⏳
**Estimated time:** 2 hours

**Objective:**
In this step, you'll connect all your previous workflows: from trend discovery and competitor monitoring to content generation, into one live pipeline. You'll set up a Supabase database to store and sync your agent's outputs, link it with n8n, and validate that all data flows correctly into your Google Sheets dashboard. By the end of this step, your entire ecosystem will be connected and automated, ready to deliver live insights, benchmark data, and creative outputs in a single place.

**Tasks:**
- Connect all previous workflows (trend discovery, competitor monitoring, content generation)
- Set up Supabase database to store and sync agent outputs
- Link Supabase with n8n
- Validate data flows into Google Sheets dashboard
- Ensure entire ecosystem is connected and automated

**Status:** Not started

### Step 2: Presenting Business Impact ⏳
**Estimated time:** 1.5 hours

**Objective:**
Create a presentation that highlights your dashboard, key insights, and the story your data tells.

**Deliverables:**
- 5–7 minute Loom presentation
- Explains system and its implications for Wayfair's business strategy
- Connects data to decisions and shows real impact

**Status:** Not started

## Integration Architecture

This project brings together:
- **Project 2:** Consumer Trend Discovery Agent (RSS feeds, Google Search, Amazon scraping)
- **Project 3:** Competitor Monitoring Agent (Wayfair + Amazon data scraping and analysis)
- **Project 4:** AI Insights & Content Agent (Creative content generation from trend signals)

All connected through:
- **Supabase Database:** Centralized data storage and sync
- **n8n Workflows:** Automated data pipelines
- **Google Sheets Dashboard:** Real-time visualization and intelligence

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Live Google Sheets Dashboard**
   - Visualizes user intent data
   - Shows competitor insights
   - Displays trend signals
   - Presents content generation outputs
   - Updates automatically from live pipelines

2. **Loom Presentation (5–7 minutes)**
