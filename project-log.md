# Project Log

## Week 1 – Orientation

- Reviewed program materials and met Program Manager Christie Andersen
- Set up n8n Cloud account and obtained Google Gemini API key
- Built basic "Hello World" workflow to test node connections
- Joined Slack community and familiarized with externship structure

## Week 2 – Project 1: Moodboard Generator

**Goal:** Build an AI workflow that turns a short style idea into a moodboard using n8n and Google Gemini.

**Workflow:**  
`When chat message received → AI Agent (Gemini Chat Model) → Code (clean prompt) → HTTP Request (Gemini Image API) → Code (parse) → Image File Converter`

**Result:**  
Generated moodboard images from prompts like "Bohemian rugs, neutral tones."  
Encountered API rate limits but confirmed full end-to-end workflow execution.
